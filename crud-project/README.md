# CrudProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Json Server 
In order to start your json local server run the "api-start" script. The other way to do that is by using "json-server --watch db.json" in your bash terminal. Please make sure that your json server is running on port http://localhost:3000, otherwise the api service won't be able to connect to the local server.
